1.the current system is maintained manually
 
 a computerized system is essential to better the communication between customers so that 
  customers can reach easily.

2.Data redundancy and data inconsistency

the current system records annual events ,upcoming events and
 enrolls students who would participate in those events.in this data entry ,
 data redundancy and data inconsistency occurs in entering when assigning the particular
 event to each and every student

3.Internal communication in the system is underdeveloped.
  communication between Administrator and external parties is vital.the Administrator is in charge 
  of reviewing events and available groups.
 
4.unavailbilty of an adequate method for large data storage(DBMS as solution)
  
  data regarding events , student details, examination details require major space.A sustainable
